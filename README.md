# Restaurant Website Project
## Overview
This project was created as part of a collaborative effort within our team to build a restaurant website. We utilized GitHub to manage our codebase, organize our work, and deploy the website using GitHub Pages.

## Project Details
Organization: We created a GitHub organization to manage the project. The organization allowed us to collaborate efficiently and maintain a centralized repository for our code.

Team: Within the organization, we formed a team consisting of team members who contributed to the project. Each team member had specific roles and responsibilities.

Website: The website we built is a restaurant website designed to showcase the restaurant's menu, services, and testimonials. It provides information about the restaurant and allows users to make reservations.

Deployment: We deployed the website using GitHub Pages, which allowed us to host the website directly from our GitHub repository. The website is accessible at Restaurant Website.

## Repository Structure
Our GitHub repository is organized into different directories:

css/: Contains the CSS files for styling the website.
images/: Contains images used on the website.
js/: Contains JavaScript files for website functionality.
